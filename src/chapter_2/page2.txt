Hello every one.

I have a lot of fun to use Git:

Git: is a version control system. It keeps tracking versions when any changes are made. Git is all about changes.

GitHub: is a platform where you can host any folders to remote repositories.

Local repository: it's just a folder to keep track of changes locally, on each device.

Remote repository: it's a folder online that keeps track of changes, but also can have changes of others.

un-versioned: not being kept track of file.

commit: means saved my changes to my local repository.


Warm up

create a package: chapter 2

create page1, add some text
commit the changes

create page2, add some text
commit the changes

push both commits to remote repository
